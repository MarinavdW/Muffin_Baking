🧁 Muffin Board - Zoho Connect Integration
A web application that integrates with Zoho Connect to manage a Muffin Baking board. Built for B& Digital Transformation technical assessment demonstrating full-stack development with OAuth integration, REST APIs, and webhook handling.

🎯 Assignment Overview
This project implements all three required tasks:

Task A: Basic Zoho Connect Integration - Authenticate and fetch board data
Task B: Create New Muffin Card - Add muffins via form/modal interface
Task C: Webhooks and Muffin Movement - Detect and log muffin movements

🗃️ Architecture

Backend: Java 17, Spring Boot 3.2.0, OAuth2, RestTemplate
Frontend: React 18, Axios, Modern CSS
Integration: Zoho Connect API with session-based authentication
Authentication: OAuth 2.0 with fallback to session cookies

🚀 Instructions to Run Locally on PC
Prerequisites

Java 17 or higher - Download from Oracle
Node.js 16+ and npm - Download from nodejs.org
Maven 3.6+ - Download from maven.apache.org

Step 1: Backend Setup

Navigate to backend directory
bashcd backend

Compile and build
bashmvn clean compile
mvn clean package -DskipTests

Run the Spring Boot application
bashjava -jar target/muffin-board-1.0.0.jar
Expected output:
Tomcat started on port 8080 (http)
Initialized in-memory storage as fallback for Zoho Connect data
Will attempt to fetch real muffin data from Zoho getTasksByView.do API


Step 2: Frontend Setup

Navigate to frontend directory (in new terminal)
bashcd frontend

Install dependencies
bashnpm install

Start React development server
bashnpm start
Expected output:
Compiled successfully!
Local: http://localhost:3000


Step 3: Access Application

Open browser to http://localhost:3000
You should see the Muffin Board with "Connect to Zoho" button
After authentication, you'll see the kanban board with real muffin data

🔑 API Setup/Credential Guidance
For Evaluators - Setting Up Your Own Zoho Connect App

Create Zoho Connect OAuth Application

Go to Zoho API Console
Create new "Server-based Applications"
Set the following:


Required OAuth Configuration:
Client Type: Web Application
Homepage URL: http://localhost:8080
Authorized Redirect URIs: http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/zoho
Scopes: ZohoConnect.share.READ,ZohoConnect.feed.READ,ZohoConnect.board.READ

Update Backend Configuration
Edit backend/src/main/resources/application.yml:
yamlspring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        registration:
          zoho:
            client-id: YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE
            client-secret: YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE
            scope: ZohoConnect.share.READ,ZohoConnect.feed.READ,ZohoConnect.board.READ
            authorization-grant-type: authorization_code
            redirect-uri: http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/zoho
        provider:
          zoho:
            authorization-uri: https://accounts.zoho.com/oauth/v2/auth
            token-uri: https://accounts.zoho.com/oauth/v2/token
            user-info-uri: https://accounts.zoho.com/oauth/user/info
            user-name-attribute: Display_Name

zoho:
  api:
    base-url: https://connect.zoho.com/api/v1
    board-id: YOUR_BOARD_ID_HERE

Set Up Zoho Connect Board

Create a board called "Muffin Baking"
Add two sections: "To Bake" and "Already Baked"
Add some test muffins to see data flow
Update board-id in configuration with your board's numeric ID


Get Board ID and Section IDs

Inspect browser network requests when viewing your board
Look for API calls containing your board and section IDs
Update ZohoConnectService.java with your specific IDs



🧪 Testing the Application
Test Task A - Basic Integration

Start both backend and frontend
Navigate to http://localhost:3000
Click "Connect to Zoho" → authenticate
Verify you see your board data displayed

Test Task B - Create New Muffin

Click "+ Add New Muffin" button
Enter muffin name (e.g., "Chocolate Chip Muffin")
Select "To Bake" list
Click "Add Muffin"
Verify new muffin appears in the board

Test Task C - Webhooks
Quick Test:
bashcurl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/webhook/test
Expected console output:
🧁 Test webhook called - Blueberry Muffin moved to 'Already Baked'
Full Webhook Test:
bashcurl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/webhook/zoho-connect \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"eventType":"task.moved","task":{"title":"Blueberry Muffin"},"fromSection":{"name":"To Bake"},"toSection":{"name":"Already Baked"}}'
Expected console output:
🧁 Blueberry Muffin moved from 'To Bake' to 'Already Baked'
🎉 Congratulations! Blueberry Muffin has been successfully baked!
🚨 Challenges and Caveats Encountered
1. Zoho Connect API Authentication Complexity
Challenge: OAuth tokens work for Zoho's general APIs but NOT for Zoho Connect's internal board APIs.
Root Cause: Zoho Connect uses session-based authentication for board operations, while OAuth tokens only work for user profile and general API access.
Solution Implemented: Hybrid authentication approach:

OAuth for user authentication and login flow
Session-based authentication (browser cookies) for board data retrieval
In-memory storage fallback for created muffins

Technical Details:
java// Session headers with actual browser cookies
headers.add("Cookie", "JSESSIONID=...; CT_CSRF_TOKEN=...; zpccn=...");
headers.add("X-Requested-With", "XMLHttpRequest");
2. API Endpoint Discovery Challenge
Challenge: Official Zoho Connect REST API endpoints returned 200 OK but empty response bodies.
Investigation Process:

Tested multiple REST endpoints: /api/v1/boards/{id}, /api/v1/boards/{id}/sections
All returned successful HTTP status but null content

Solution: Used browser developer tools to reverse-engineer working endpoints:

Identified internal API: getTasksByView.do
Captured exact parameters and headers from working browser requests
Implemented session-based calls to these internal endpoints

3. Cross-Origin Session Management
Challenge: Sessions created on localhost:8080 (OAuth) not shared with localhost:3000 (React dev server proxy).
Impact: Users would authenticate successfully but appear as "not authenticated" to the React app.
Solution: Configured proper CORS settings and OAuth redirect URLs:
javaconfiguration.setAllowCredentials(true);
.defaultSuccessUrl("http://localhost:3000", true)
4. Data Persistence Strategy
Challenge: Created muffins need to persist but can't be reliably stored in Zoho Connect via API.
Solution: Implemented intelligent fallback system:
java// 1. Try to create in real Zoho Connect
MuffinCard realZohoCard = createTaskInZohoConnect(muffinName, listId);
if (realZohoCard != null) return realZohoCard;

// 2. Fallback to in-memory storage
sectionCards.computeIfAbsent(listId, k -> new ArrayList<>()).add(card);
5. Session Cookie Complexity
Caveat: The application currently uses hardcoded session cookies extracted from a working browser session.
Limitation: These cookies will expire, requiring manual refresh for full functionality.
Impact: OAuth authentication always works, but real Zoho data fetching depends on valid session cookies.
